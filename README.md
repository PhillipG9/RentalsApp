# RentalsApp

I have been writing this program to practice building GUI applications. It is done with the Tkinter module.

My goals for this project:
- To learn new skills when building GUIs.
- Learn new skills using PostgreSQL.
- Complete tasks for PostgreSQL using Python.

This program will be built overtime and I will make adjustments as they are completed.

Thanks for looking at my code.

Corrections:
- commit message should be -Added parameter to init method to stop the rebuilding of the homepage.-
